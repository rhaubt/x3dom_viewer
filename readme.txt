DESCRIPTION

This is a test viewer implemented in the www.rockartdatabase.com project to display and help with basic analysis of 2D images and 3D models. The tool allows the user to place markers, measure distances, identify colour schemes, identify colours using a native colour picker and adjust colour in images and 3D models for color frequency spectrum analysis.
